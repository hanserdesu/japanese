"""Regression test for the reported 已学词测试 bug:
English stem + Japanese options (screenshot: superiority + 割れる/黄色/続ける/歯医者).

Reproduces the broken state (allTestWordsS10_Para and S8needToLearnWordList_Para both
stale-English while the options are fresh Japanese) and checks that the v1.7.1
HealTestList book-validity rule heals it, where the old alignment-only rule did not.

The broken pool/stem are CONSTRUCTED from out-of-book learned words rather than read
from the live save: once the plugin heals the save the live state is no longer broken,
and a fixture that reads it would silently stop testing anything.
